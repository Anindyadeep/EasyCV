# EasyCV
Making Computer Vision based applications and services simple, fast and robust and user friendly.

## Our Goal

Our main goal is to manage, scale and make Computer Vision based stuffs as abstract as possible. We try to manage CV services like Face recognition, Object Detection, Segmentation and many other CV stuffs. 
This library would be special because, we will not only make the implemetation to initiate those CV tasks in most abstract way, but also try to provide some of the extended services, which includes, putting the data (requiring for CV, and outputs, and other additional files) to respective databases. Connecting these services with Cloud services, in order to get extended features. So in one word, if our project includesany sort of stuff, that requires a vision pipeline, then this library would keep its potential to solve in the most scalable way as possible.

## Our Roadmap

1. Creating the very basic models of different CV tasks, which would include pre-build models.
2. Extending those to connecting with different types of databases, and cloud services.
3. Dashboarding and monitoring performances.
4. Other additional services.
